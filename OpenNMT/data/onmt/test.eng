We can't pretend it never happened.
Do we need a Plan B?
The store might be closed already.
Who are you talking about?
In the mountain area, snow has fallen more than fifty centimeters deep.
He doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why.
I'll try to explain it to the best of my ability.
They all listened.
She's mine.
Now, take a deep breath.
I want you to get started right away.
We reported his disappearance.
Why isn't Tom doing something?
Congratulations!
It is not safe for a girl to go out by herself so late at night.
Give me a ride home.
What are you doing?
I see you reading.
Do we know you?
I'm taking notes.
Tom translated the contract into French.
He was arrested because he stole the money.
I know your father.
We hope Tom sticks around for a couple of weeks.
How did Tom solve the problem?
Tom worked until late at night.
How will you manage without a job?
I had some calls to make.
I'm at a loss for words.
As a result of the collision, one of the passengers was thrown out.
In a word, life is short.
They aren't stupid.
He showed me how to use this camera.
This is what's going to happen.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
Do whatever's required.
The train was almost empty.
Did anybody follow you?
Do you like tea?
Some people never listen.
You're the tallest person here.
This is my life's ambition.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world.
They burned themselves.
They all drank.
We need Tom's strength now.
I just want to hug you.
The book is on the table.
Tom might not make it in time.
Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
I made that for you.
First, let us talk about the experiments conducted in laboratories.
Tom must be winning.
I've had enough.
No one's going to see us.
Where can we meet you?
That car is really expensive.
Tom didn't get what he wanted.
I know you are rich.
I have plans with Tom tonight.
Tom won't be that easy to convince.
Both of my kids have already graduated from high school.
Can you see the woman standing behind Tom? That's Mary.
We have pictures.
Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
They drove home.
Tom knows what this means.
Thanks for the support.
Are you hungry?
I was a teacher.
Does anybody know him?
He comes here every five days.
Who are you talking about?
They don't care.
Tom is married to a foreigner.
They followed you.
I want some beautiful flowers to put on the table.
He's not the same man he used to be.
We have plans.
I'm ready for a vacation.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
You have thirty minutes left.
They aren't here.
We have made friends with Tom.
It was his fault.
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
Let me walk you to your car.
He isn't alone anymore.
You're still young.
We're finding it difficult deciding on which one to buy.
Their flag is blue and gold.
Tom had never seen Mary so happy.
Get dressed quickly.
Tom wept.
Aren't you going to dance?
Some kinds of food make us thirsty.
I know it's impossible.
Mary thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought Tom was supposed to be in Boston. What's he doing here?
My car ran out of gas.
I like candy.
Tom doesn't have to be at today's meeting.
Tom is watching TV now.
I don't like it either.
No one here pays.
They came in.
Are you tired?
Tom almost never asks about that.
Do you live here?
All the passengers were killed in the airplane crash.
Where is the dog?
I, too, like candy.
I wish I was in Boston.
I want to see you smile.
We didn't talk yesterday.
I don't know.
It cannot be true.

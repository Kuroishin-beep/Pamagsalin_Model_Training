I had never been there before.
My boss called me into his office.
Tom made three changes.
Tom is drinking water.
The entire nation was glad at the news.
Are you at home, too?
He said he could do it.
Don't expose it to the rain.
Don't tell him.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
They all stopped.
They don't understand.
Don't let him keep this picture.
I think you know what we have to do.
She quickly went up the stairs.
They can't escape.
What's your son's name?
Tom escaped from his cell.
She has psychic abilities.
Would you like something to drink?
That boy over there looks about the same age as you.
They went to an expensive restaurant for lunch.
It is very important to keep your word.
I am free of debt.
He proposed that we should start at once.
I've heard this song before.
Tom was at the gym for three hours yesterday.
They arrested him.
You never said anything.
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
I'll give it to you.
I think Tom did the best he could.
How are you?
Tom went to Boston three years ago.
It was a gift.
My parents still haven't met my girlfriend.
They all sat.
Tom used to play the piano when he was younger.
Now we don't know what to do.
Listen to Tom.
Hurry up.
I'll wait for you.
Your watch seems to be very valuable.
They all screamed.
Why don't we order pizza?
Yesterday was my birthday.
I love you.
Take a look at that.
Tom wanted to stick around for a few more days.
It's not my fault.
They finally left.
They caught me.
She is a famous singer.
Can't you go by yourself?
They want to know what's happening.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom won that contest.
We sometimes make mistakes.
It looks like Tom was right.
Nobody likes bad news.
Answer the question.
Tom wanted to save the world.
We close at 2:30.
He laid his bag on the table.
If anything happens, we'll be in in three seconds.
Tom had something in his hand.
What should you do if you are bitten by a cobra?
We looked down at the beautiful sea.
Did you know that?
As far as I know, Tom is still married.
Did you lose something?
I was up all night reading.
This house has a solid foundation.
I'll tell you everything.
You are my friend.
Tom may be back.
We didn't talk yesterday.
I just want you to know that Tom is safe.
You can't possibly win.
He always told me the truth.
Congratulations!
Are you married?
What did you do to each other?
My prayers were answered.
I didn't even know that you used to live in Boston.
Tom wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
Just get back.
I'll be with you in ten minutes.
I asked for grape juice.
I need to buy some rat poison.
We have plans.
They all rose.
What did Tom say about what happened?
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom took everything to his office.
They both coughed.
Let's not go.
All my friends like you.
She decided to be a doctor.
I am thankful for my children.
It's a dictionary.
Is it yours?
Tom used to go fishing with his father.
We have a lot to celebrate.
Really?
Here's one I forgot.
Tom doesn't have a girlfriend.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
Eternal love doesn't exist.
He died yesterday.
Do you study English?
You have told Tom the truth, haven't you?
I'll call you back later.
Get lost!

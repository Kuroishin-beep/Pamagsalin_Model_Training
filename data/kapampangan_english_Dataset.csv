,,
,,
,,
,"Yeah, we stock up too. It’s a healthy alternative.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"On weekends, my siblings and I bake cookies and cakes. The house smells amazing.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"In our home, we usually bake brownies and eat them fresh from the oven.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I drink a lot of water everyday to stay healthy.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s a good habit! I try to skip soft drinks too.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"We go to the market a lot for fresh veggies, meat, and seafood.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Us too. Nothing beats fresh ingredients when cooking.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Every morning, I ride the jeepney to school. I always leave early to avoid traffic.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same here. I’ve learned to leave earlier or I’ll end up late.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"We planned our family vacation months ago, booked our flights and hotel early.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Nice! We did that too last summer. It saved us a lot of stress.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I usually just walk to the grocery store. It’s cheaper than driving.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s what I do when I’m not in a rush. Good for the environment too.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"When it rains, my dad drives me to school since the streets get slippery",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,My dad does that too. Commuting during bad weather is sometimes dangerous.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"When we travel to other cities, we usually take the train. It’s fast and has a scenic view.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same here. I love watching the countryside through the window.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I bike around our village. It’s fun and helps me stay active.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I like biking too. It gets me moving while getting things done.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,We always wear seatbelts in the car and helmets on the motorbike.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Safety first, always. Even short rides can be risky.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Flying is fun, especially the first time. Looking out the window feels amazing.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Yes! I was only looking at the window the first time I flew.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Tricycles are super useful for travelling to nearby places.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yeah, especially in places with limited transport options.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"At night, we drive slowly, keep our headlights on, and stay alert.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Better safe than sorry. Night driving can be tricky.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"I went shopping yesterday, but everything was so expensive.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Did you try asking for a discount?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yeah, I asked, ""Can you give me a discount if I buy a lot?""",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,They said the prices were already final.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s frustrating. I usually check prices online before buying.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same here. Sometimes online is even cheaper than stores.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,True. Do they at least accept gcash?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes, they accept both gcash and credit cards.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"That’s good. One time, I forgot my wallet so couldn’t pay at the counter.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Oh no! Did they let you return later to pay?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yeah, but it was embarrassing. Better safe than sorry.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Have you ever been charged twice for the same item?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes! It happened to me last month, I had to ask for a refund.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Refunds can take so long, though.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s why I prefer using cash when possible.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"But if you use a loyalty card, you get points for every purchase.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s true. I actually saved up enough points to get a free item.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Lucky you! Last time, I spent almost half my paycheck on gadgets.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m trying to stick to a budget this month so that doesn’t happen again.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same here. Better to plan than run out of money.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Hey! How have you been?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"I’ve been good, just busy with work.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yeah, same here. Have you been going out lately?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Not much, I’ve mostly stayed at home.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Makes sense. Sometimes it’s nice to just relax.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,True! Do you still hang out with our old friends?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes, we meet up every other weekend.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That’s great! I miss those small gatherings.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,You should join us next time!,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I’d love to. Do you still go to the same café?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes, the one near the park.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I like that place.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,It’s quiet and the coffee’s really good.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Have you tried their new menu yet?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Not yet, I always order the same thing.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Same here, I never change my order.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,We should go together next week.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That sounds fun! What day works for you?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Saturday would be perfect.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Okay, I’ll message you the details.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,How are you?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Where do you live?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Why are you interested in learning Spanish now, after all these years?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,When do you usually feel the most productive—morning or late at night?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Who taught you how to cook such delicious pasta?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,What kind of books do you enjoy reading in your free time?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Which restaurant do you usually go to when you're craving something spicy?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,How do you manage to stay so organized with such a busy schedule?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Why didn’t you attend the meeting yesterday? Everything okay?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Where did you grow up, and how was your childhood there?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"What’s your favorite way to unwind after a long, stressful day?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Who's someone that has inspired you a lot in your life?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"When did you start learning to play the guitar, and how long did it take?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Why do you think people struggle with time management so much?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"How often do you go hiking, and where’s your favorite trail?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Which movie would you recommend for a fun night watch?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Who was the last person you talked to before going to sleep last night?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,What motivates you to keep pushing through hard days?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Where can I find the nearest pharmacy that's still open at this hour?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,When was the last time you tried something completely new?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Are you already at the mall?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Not yet, I’m walking from the bus stop now.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Which entrance are you going to use?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"The one near the food court, it’s closer.",
,,
,,
,,
,"Okay, I’ll wait for you at the escalator.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Are you coming from the north side or south side?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"From the south side, traffic was bad.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Do you see the fountain in the center?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes, I’m walking past it now.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Turn right after the fountain, the escalator is there.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Got it, I’m heading up now.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Are you on the second floor already?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Yes, I’m standing near the bookstore.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Okay, I’ll walk towards you.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Can you see me coming from the left side?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Not yet, I’m checking the crowd.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m waving my hand now so you can see me.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,There you are! I’ll move closer.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Let’s walk straight to the food court.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,It’s just over to the right.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Could you pass me the charger on the table? I need to charge my phone right now.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Sure, here you go. Let me know if you need anything else.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Don’t forget to lock the door when you leave, especially if no one’s home.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Got it. I’ll make sure to lock it. Thanks for the reminder.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Can you help me carry these bags upstairs? They’re a bit heavy for me alone.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,No problem. I’ll carry some so it’s easier for you.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Please email me the report before 5 PM so I can review it before the meeting.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Sure, I’ll send it before then. Hope it helps during the meeting.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Wait for me at the entrance—I’ll just grab my jacket and be right out.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,No rush. I’ll wait here.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Could you explain what you said again? I didn’t really understand what you meant.,
,,
,,
,Of course. I’ll make it clearer this time.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Stop scrolling for a moment and listen.I need to tell you something important,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Oh, sorry. I’m listening now. What is it?",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Please speak slowly so I can understand. English isn’t my first language.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Ah, got it. I’ll slow down, sorry about that.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Remind me to water the plants tomorrow morning, or they’ll dry out again.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,No worries. I’ll remind you first thing tomorrow.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Just be honest with me. I’d rather hear the truth directly.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I respect that. I won’t keep anything from you.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I feel incredibly grateful for all the support during those hard times.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"You handled it well, it really shows.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"That movie caught me off guard,I actually cried.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same here. It was more emotional than I expected.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,It frustrates me when people don’t listen before jumping in.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"I understand. Everyone wants to be heard, but few want to listen.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,She’s so passionate about helping the environment.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I admire that kind of dedication.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"I was nervous before the interview, but it went well.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,See? You were more prepared than you thought.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Crowded places really make me anxious.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Then let’s stay somewhere quiet, if that helps.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m really proud of how far you’ve come.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Thank you, it means a lot coming from you.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"The news shocked me, I needed time to process it.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Take all the time you need. Processing takes time too.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,She looked upset but didn’t want to talk.,
,,
,,
,,
,Maybe she just needed to be alone.,
,,
,,
,,
,I think everyone deserves another chance.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"True. People change, and growth takes time.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I watched the sunset behind the mountains.,
,,
,,
,,
,That sounds beautiful. I wish I saw it too.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I walked slowly through the gallery. Every painting felt like a story.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I love when art speaks like that.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"That house looked abandoned, plants on the walls, dust everywhere.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Like it’s been forgotten for years.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Be careful with that glass, it’s from my grandmother.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"Don’t worry, I’ll handle it gently.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I found old photos in a box I forgot I had.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,How deep did the memory hit you?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"When the rain came, I just stood there.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,That smell always takes me back to my childhood.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,He read the letter out loud.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,The must have been tense,
,,
,,
,,
,"I ran so hard, my legs almost gave up",
,And you didn’t stop. That’s grit.,
,"When she sang, my eyes only looked at her.",
,That’s what real presence feels like.,
,"I stood at the edge of the stage, nervous but ready",
,And you stepped forward anyway.,
,"I just woke up, did you already eat?",
,I’m thinking of skipping today. You in?,
,I haven’t done anything all day. What about you?,
,I saw something that reminded me of you.,
,I want to go out. You feel like going somewhere?,
,I forgot what I was going to say to you.,
,I’ve been so lazy lately. How about you?,
,Same here. My bed is winning,
,I tried cooking today... it didn’t turn out good.,
,What happened? Did it burn?,
,I miss just talking with you.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Me too. We should do that soon.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I like days like this,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Quiet and simple.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I can’t sleep lately. You too?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Same. My brain’s just too loud.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I'm watching a movie right now. What are you watching now?,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,I'm rewatching that show you told me about!,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,"I’m trying not to spend, but I saw something I want.",
,,
,,
,,
,,
,Buy it! Treat yourself.,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,,
,How are you today?,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m doing fine.,
,,
,,
,,
,You’re so ugly.,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m hungry.,
,,
,,
,,
,Where are you?,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m on the way.,
,,
,,
,,
,What should we talk about?,
,,
,,
,,
,I’m sorry.,
,,
,,
,,
,Let’s eat.,
,,
,,
,,
,The weather is bad.,
,,
,,
,,
,Have a good day!,
,,
,,
,,
,Thank you very much!,
,,
,,
,,
,You look so beautiful today.,
,,
,,
,,
,Wait a second.,
,You’re welcome!,
,Just kidding.,
,I’ll call you back later.,
,I feel happy today.,
,You always make me smile.,
,I just woke up.,
,I got a lot to do today.,
,Where were you from?,
,Get out of there!,
,What time is it?,
,Go sit over there.,
,Stand up straight.,
,What are you doing,
,Let’s go over there.,
,That’s it.,
,I love you.,
,Like no one is worrying about you,
,Good morning!,
,Good afternoon!,
,Good evening!,
,I’m going down.,
,I’m going up.,
,I’m going left.,
,I’m going right.,
,Let’s go.,
,Can you go faster?,
